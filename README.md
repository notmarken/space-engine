This project simulates celestial objects. NOTE: HEAVILY INSPIRED BY SEBASTIAN LAGUE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7axImc1sxa0&t 

Formula:

Now I'm no mathematician but I think newton was onto something, so I trust the formula.

Here you have the inspector, showing that element 0 is the "main" planet (this is only for the trails, choosing which makes more sense.)
You can choose G (gravitational constant), Steps (how far the trails will go into the future) and time step (how long between the steps)

You can also choose stats for each individual body.

Initial velocity makes sure objects go straight into eachother, basically starting with an orbit.
Mass is mass.

Here is an example scene set up in SampleScene

Here you can see a "solar system" I set up, where all planet trails are relative to the star in the middle. The star in the middle has a way higher gravity mass.
